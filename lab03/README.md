## Difficulties
- I think for me the hardest thing about css and the front-end tools, is I get confused between all the different things and I mix things together, I know the documentation is always there but I get lost about which style should I use.


## Stuff I've learned
- I've learned the difference between ID selector and class selector, I've also learned about drop caps and CSS pseudo-elements.
